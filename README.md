# OpenFrameworks Tutorial code

This repository is based on @lewislepton 's [OpenFrameworks tutorial videos](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/openframeworks-tutorial-series/32886/5). I veered away from creating a new OF project for each episode, as the  videos suggest, and instead did my best to add a  comment  above the crucial  code for each episode with the name of the episode that I was following.
